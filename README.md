# Spaceman

## *This Spaceman version of the game is set in outer space. The player who chooses to help Spaceman on his journey is given six wrong guesses to help him get closer to his next planet. Once you have guessed the correct word, the Spaceman is off the explore. If you fail, the spaceman is out of space and back to earth, but remember, you are given a chance to try again.*
