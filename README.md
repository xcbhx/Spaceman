## **Getting Started:** <br>
<a href="https://xcbhx.github.io/Spaceman/">Deployed Link</a>

## **Next Steps:** <br>
<ul>
<li>One of my future enhancements would be adding categories so players can select from a list of different categories.</li> 
<li>The second enhancement would be to add audio, so it can play while the users are interacting with the page.</li>
<li>The third enhancement would be to add a gif of spaceman on a rocketship when the game has been won.</li>
</ul>
