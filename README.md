# Spaceman

## *This Spaceman version of the game is set in outer space. Players help Spaceman discover new planets by guessing the correct letters for each word.* 
<br>

#### The player who chooses to help Spaceman on his journey is given six wrong guesses to help him get closer to his next planet.
